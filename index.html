    <h2>The Founding</h2>
    <div class="description">
      <p>Around 2009, before Black Dragons there was a clan named; "Rude Mafia" (RM). This clan lasted for about a year and in the fall, two members, TheGreene2010 (DoomBasedDivine) and HITMANTA47 (Ascendant Hit) forged a new path, thus Black Dragons (BLAK) was born! In the wake of Rude Mafia's demise, we recurited former RM members most noteable MEXICANTAHLIBAN. <a href="https://account.xbox.com/en-us/clubs/profile?clubid=3379856998059040/" title="Xbox Link">Black Dragons</a> is mostly active on the Xbox platform, but has branches on all platforms! Our huge leap in popularity took the form of the Rockstar Games Social Club, when they launched their crews in 2012, just before the launch of Max Payne 3. During the prime of Max Payne 3's multiplayer, our clan of about 12 active members was brushing scores with top crews of the time. Some noteable members where quoted saying "Like in the Movies!", whilst jumping out of windows with RPGs!</p>
      <h3>"Like in The Movies!"</h3>
      <p>In 2013 Rockstar Games Launched GTA V and Black Dragons became stronger recuiting more members. We left Brazil behind and took over Los Santos! To this day our members play a mutitude of video games, Forza, Gears of War, Call of Duty... dominating on all with brutality!
